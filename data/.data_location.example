# External Data Directory Configuration
# 
# This file allows you to store your DotA Coach data on an external drive
# to save space on your main drive.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create the directory structure on your external drive first
# 2. Copy your existing data/ folder contents to the external location
# 3. Save this file as ".data_location" (without .example)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# For Mac users:
# /Volumes/YourDriveName/.../AI_DotA_Coach/data
#
# For Windows users:
# D:\...\AI_DotA_Coach\data
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Use absolute paths only (full path starting from root)
# - Make sure the full directory (incl sub-directories following the codebase) exists before running the program
# - If any expected subdirectory is missing, it will return an error
# - On Windows, if your drive letter changes (D: becomes E:), the program will try to find it
#
# SETUP STEPS:
# 1. Create this directory structure on your external drive:
#    YourDriveName/.../AI_DotA_Coach/data/
# 2. Copy existing data from your codebase to this location
# 3. Enter your path below
